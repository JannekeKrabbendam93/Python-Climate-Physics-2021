# Python-Climate-Physics-2021
This repository contains all information and materials for the introduction to Python for Climate Physics students 2021 of IMAU at Utrecht University. 

# Workshops
There will be four workshops, which will be face to face!
For now, I am planning to meet you each Friday 13:00-15:00, starting on September 17th until October 8th. 
During the workshops, I will first introduce the topic and the exercises, then we will work on the exercises and questions that may arise. Feel free to attend only
one or a few of the workshops if you are already familiar with Python.

1 - [Friday 17 Sept; 13:00-15:00 (Min 2.01)] basic programming in Python: data types, lists, dictionaries, loops, conditionals, functions, basic unix commands

2 - [Friday 24 Sept; 13:00-15:00 (BBG 079)] common Python packages and basic plotting: numpy, matplotlib, scipy

3 - [Friday 1 Oct; 13:00-15:00 (BBG 065)] working with data: pandas, netcdf4/xarray

4 - [Friday 8 Oct; 13:00-15:00 (BBG 065)] mapping with cartopy

# Materials
There are several editors in which you can write Python code, but during this introduction I will provide you with Jupyter Notebooks. 
Jupyter Notebook is an interactive computing environment, through which you are able to write and run Python code. The advantages of using 
such an environment are numerous, among which the possibility of interactively writing and running code, and integrating code and text elements 
in the same document. Jupyter Notebook is part of the Anaconda package, instructions on how to download and install can be found in this repository. The Notebooks for each workshop are also found here.

If you are very new to Python and want some extra practice: there is an app called DataCamp. This is similar to DuoLingo, which most of you probably know, 
but then for coding in Python :)
